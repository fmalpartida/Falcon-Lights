## Geek Kids Project
The board has been developed by electronFUN under the Geek Kids initiative. 

The Geek Kids initiative is a local electroFUN project where we try to bring youngsters close to technology. Kids under the initiative get exposed to technology, projects while participating in them to bring up to speed for the general public. 

All these projects are released under the Geek Kids logo and are Open Source for everyone to enjoy. 

All the benefits derived from Geek Kids projects will revert back to the initiative and will help them develop more stuff and reachout to more kids.

Stay tunned.
